# Fluent Builder Design Pattern in C#

This repository demonstrates the **Fluent Builder Design Pattern** in C#, showcasing how it differs from the traditional builder approach for creating complex objects. By using this pattern, developers can write cleaner, more readable, and more maintainable code for object construction.

## 🚀 What is the Fluent Builder Pattern?
The Fluent Builder pattern is an advanced implementation of the Builder Design Pattern. It leverages **method chaining** to create objects step by step, allowing for a more readable and intuitive API. This approach is especially useful for constructing objects with numerous properties or configurations.

### 🆚 Fluent Builder vs. Traditional Builder
| Feature                 | Traditional Builder             | Fluent Builder                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Readability**         | Step-by-step, more verbose      | Chainable, concise, intuitive |
| **Ease of Use**         | Requires intermediate objects   | Streamlined with method chaining |
| **Flexibility**         | Moderate customization          | Highly customizable with clean syntax |

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository contains:
- **Examples of the traditional builder pattern**: Demonstrating the step-by-step approach.
- **Examples of the fluent builder pattern**: Showcasing method chaining for a cleaner API.

## 📖 Usage Guide
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrEshboboyev/fluent-builder-design-pattern.git
cd fluent-builder-design-pattern
```
Step 2: Open the Project
Open the project in your favorite C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).

Step 3: Run the Examples
Run the provided examples to see the differences between traditional and fluent builder patterns.

🛠 Code Example
Here’s a quick comparison:

Without Builder :
```bash
var test = new Test
    {
        Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
        TestName = createTestRequest.TestName,
        Description = createTestRequest.Description,
        StartDate = createTestRequest.StartDate,
        EndDate = createTestRequest.EndDate,
        IsActive = createTestRequest.IsActive,
        Tags = createTestRequest.Tags,
        Difficulty = createTestRequest.Difficulty,
        MaxParticipants = createTestRequest.MaxParticipants,
        Sections = createTestRequest.Sections.Select(s => new TestSection
        {
            Title = s.Title,
            TimeLimit = s.TimeLimit,
            QuestionCount = s.QuestionCount
        }).ToList()
    };
```
With Builder : 
```bash
var test = new TestBuilder()
        .WithBasicInfo(
            createTestRequest.TestName,
            createTestRequest.Description,
            createTestRequest.StartDate,
            createTestRequest.EndDate)
        .WithIsActive(createTestRequest.IsActive)
        .WithTags(createTestRequest.Tags)
        .WithDifficulty(createTestRequest.Difficulty)
        .WithMaxParticipants(createTestRequest.MaxParticipants)
        .WithSections(createTestRequest.Sections)
        .Build();
```

🌟 Benefits of the Fluent Builder Pattern
Improved Readability: Code is easier to understand with method chaining.
Clean API: Reduces clutter and complexity in object creation.
Extensibility: Easily extendable for future requirements.
